Really the maser challenge! On inspecting the page source, we get two random strings. Using base64 encoding, we get 13 X 13 = 169 for the top string
and some ~~~~.~~.~~ string for the second one. Using some standard ciphes on the second string, ROT13 worked fine and gave r3G15T3r.tar.gz.
Downloading this tar.gz file from the URL gave us r3G15T3r.html file which when passed into URL gave us register interface. Now admin registration was
not possible, so we used mysql truncating and registered using "admin " username. Now we get login access to team review submission. SQL injection wasn't
easy because of input sanitization but URL encoding quotes and passing the sql commands using referer value in header worked. Using the techniques
on blind SQL injections using conditional errors in MySQL and checking the characters of db name one by one, we get the flag (script provided with
the zip file)
