The main point to notice in this was that offset was declared as char and not as int, this took a lot of time, once this was realized then the
question was a simple one as the overflow directly lead us to the location of got and we replaced it with the address of system. We tried to do
this using pwntools but we were not able to debug it using gdb hence we wrote the input to the executable in a file since we could debug it with gdb.
We are attaching the txt file.
