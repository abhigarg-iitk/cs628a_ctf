For this question after we analysed the packet sent by udpclient through wireshark we found that it had a destination ip 1.1.1.1. We changed it to our ip. Then we figured out that 1.1.1.1 was present for a purpose. It was the trusted ip for the machine. So basically it would recieve packets only from 1.1.1.1 and send to destination which was us. We then used ipforge.py script (avaliable online) online to forge our ip tp 1.1.1.1 and listned to response via wireshark And we had the flag.
