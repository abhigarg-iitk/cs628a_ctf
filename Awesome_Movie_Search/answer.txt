This question is based on SQL Injection. On trying some pattern matching queries, for example LIKE "cs628a{%", we get to know that the given flag is not in
the reviews table and we try getting the other column names from sqlite_master table. This tell us that there is another director column which contains the flag.
We start matching patterns by running script (also in this directory) and flag is there on the screen ( NOTE:- Run the script using python -W ignore )
